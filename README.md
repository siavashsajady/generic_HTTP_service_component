# Code Challenge: Reusable HTTP Service in React

This repository contains a code challenge that was used in an online interview for a junior front-end developer role. The objective of this challenge is to create a reusable and generic HTTP service for handling RESTful API requests in a React application. I've provided a more detailed explanation about this project in a post on my blog.
